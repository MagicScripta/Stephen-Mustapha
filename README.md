# Stephen Mustapha's About Me - Web Version
This is a one page website that tells you pretty much everything you need to know about me, from my professional experience and projects I've worked on to what I do with my free time.
The website is hosted at:
www.stephenmustapha.com
Feel free to check it out.

## Tools
I intend to add little projects to this section of the website, this is to show the kind of work I am currently intrigued by software wise.
### OpenAI Bot
This is my implementation of the ChatGPT API. This tool will take your voice input, transcribe it to text and use that with the gpt-3.5-turbo model of open AI to have a friendly conversation with you. 
I've bounced it through a one page backend api hosted on vercel and capped it at a maximum of 100 requests per day for each device.
